// WalletService — the app-facing wallet surface (spec Part 3 wallet row, Week 7)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// C# port of src/modules/wallet/ (useGameWallet.ts + walletConfig.ts). The React
// hook wraps @solana/wallet-adapter-react; the Unity port wraps the Solana Unity
// SDK. The SDK is NOT installed yet — its install is deferred to Week 7 (see the
// unity-decisions.md row dated 2026-05-18). So WalletService talks to an
// IWalletProvider INTERFACE, and the only provider shipped today is the
// devnet-mock StubWalletProvider. When the SDK lands, a SolanaWalletProvider
// implementing IWalletProvider slots in with NO change to WalletService or any
// caller — the seam is the interface.
//
// Devnet-only by design: spec Part 10 forbids real-mainnet transactions; the
// WalletNetwork enum ships as Devnet and the flip to Mainnet is owner-gated.
//
// Async: every wallet operation returns UniTask (never async void) per the
// port-spec "async UniTask" mandate (Part 3).

        // NOW KILL LIVE SALES. It read "TEMPORARILY MAINNET ... REVERT TO Devnet THE MOMENT THE
        // CANARY IS DONE", and described safety as resting on a canary-only allowlist: one SKU, one
        // wallet. That was TRUE on 2026-08-23 and every clause of it is now FALSE:
        //   * the owner ruled the FULL authored ladder live (WO-1159) - 27 SKUs, $1.99-$49.99;
        //   * the server quotes every one of them on mainnet-beta (verified live 2026-08-25);
        //   * two real ladder purchases SETTLED (391 SKR each) into the 2-of-3 treasury vault;
        //   * the owner has since WITHDRAWN that revenue on chain.

        // believing it was following canon - the exact failure class CLAUDE.md sec.15 exists to stop,
        // and the reason a stale instruction is more dangerous than no instruction at all.
        //
        // ⛔ THE MATCHED PAIR STILL GOVERNS (CANON_GROUND_TRUTH_2026-08-23): this constant is safe at
        // Mainnet ONLY while FeatureFlags.RealmStorePurchase is true, and that flag is safe ONLY

        // indistinguishable from real revenue. MonetizationActivationRegression pins BOTH; moving
        // either one alone turns the suite red, on purpose. Move them together or not at all.
        //
