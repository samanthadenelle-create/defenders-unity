// SolanaWalletProvider — the real Solana Unity SDK IWalletProvider (Week 7)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the production wallet seam. It implements IWalletProvider over the
// Solana Unity SDK (the maintained Unity C# SDK — magicblock-labs /
// Solana.Unity-SDK, the Solana Foundation Unity SDK). When the SDK package is
// resolved, WalletService routes Connect / GetBalance / Pay through here. When
// it is not, WalletService transparently falls back to StubWalletProvider.
//
// ── COMPILES WITH OR WITHOUT THE SDK ─────────────────────────────────────────
// All SDK-touching code lives inside `#if SOLANA_SDK`. The `SOLANA_SDK` scripting
// define is NOT set by the agent — the integrator adds it (Project Settings ▸
// Player ▸ Scripting Define Symbols, or a csc.rsp) once the Solana Unity SDK
// package resolves in Unity. With the define OFF, this file still compiles: the
// class exists, IsSdkAvailable returns false, and every method fails cleanly
// with a descriptive error so WalletService can pick the stub instead.
//
// This isolation is deliberate (v2-unity-port-spec.md "isolate SDK-touching
// code and guard it"): the SDK's exact API surface is volatile across versions,
// so confining every SDK call to one guarded file means an SDK-version mismatch
// breaks ONLY this file's #if block, never the whole Wallet module.
//
// ── DEVNET ONLY (spec Part 10) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every call takes the WalletNetwork from WalletService (Devnet in the v2
// foundation). RPC URLs + token mints resolve through WalletEndpoints. The agent
// never selects Mainnet.
//
// ── NO SECRETS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The game holds NO private key. The player's own wallet — Phantom (desktop
// deep-link) or the Seeker Seed Vault via Mobile Wallet Adapter — owns the key
// and signs every transaction. This provider only builds the unsigned transfer
// and hands it to the connected wallet to sign + send.
//
// ── INTEGRATOR-VERIFY API CALLS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// The exact SDK type/method names below are the agent's best knowledge of the
// Solana Unity SDK and are FLAGGED in docs/port-notes/week7-wallet.md. Each
// uncertain call is marked `// SDK-VERIFY:` inline. If a name differs in the
// resolved SDK version, the fix is local to this file's #if block.
//
// WO-766 SWEEP (2026-08-02): every marker was re-checked statically against
// the PINNED package (magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK v1.2.9; see
// Packages/manifest.json) by reading the SDK sources (Web3.cs, WalletBase.cs).
// Items now annotated "VERIFIED (v1.2.9)" are confirmed; drift found and FIXED:
//   * LoginPhantom() does not exist in v1.2.9 - desktop branch removed
//     (desktop/editor stay on StubWalletProvider; SOLANA_SDK is Android-only).
//   * Web3.Logout() is synchronous void, not awaitable.
//   * Web3.Instance is a scene MonoBehaviour singleton nothing created -
//     EnsureWeb3Host() now lazily creates + configures it before login.
//   * Tx build switched from TransactionBuilder.Build(empty)+Deserialize to
//     the SDK-documented Transaction-model + SignAndSendTransaction pattern.
// Markers that remain SDK-VERIFY could not be confirmed without a package
// resolve - the orchestrator's compile gate surfaces any residue there.
//
// WO-766 SAFETY INVARIANT (spec s3): this provider is used for IDENTITY +
// cloud-save MESSAGE-signing only. The only transfer-constructing code in the
// wallet module is SendPayment below, and it is UNREACHABLE in release:
// PackStore.Purchase refuses when FeatureFlags.RealmStorePurchase is OFF (the
// release default) before anything can reach WalletService.Pay/PayFlat.
// Connect + SignMessage are gasless and move no funds.
