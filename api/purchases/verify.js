// ⛔ THE CHANGE THIS FILE CARRIES: for a real pack there is no constant to check.
// The amount is whatever the SERVER quoted at purchase time (purchase_quotes),
// looked up by the quote id the client presents. The client transfers exactly
// that; it does no arithmetic and it is authoritative for nothing.
//
// The two CANARIES are the deliberate exception and are untouched: their amount
// IS a protocol constant (a proof-of-rail, not a sale), so they still verify
// against api/_lib/purchase-catalog's pinned row, need no quote, and consult no
// rate. A live mainnet canary purchase succeeded against exactly those numbers.

 * The rate to REPORT and to COPY FORWARD for a quote row — WO-1818.
 *
 * ⛔ NOTHING HERE RECOMPUTES AN AMOUNT. This file checks the chain against
 * `contractFromQuoteRow(quote)` (:305, compared by exact string at :88), so the
 * flat ladder needs no arithmetic change at all: the amount the verifier accepts
 * is the one the server PERSISTED when it issued the quote, flat or derived.
 * This helper is only about the rate FIELD.
 *
 * ⚠ A flat quote persists `usd_rate = 0` because the column is NOT NULL
 * (api/schema.sql:1366) and there is no rate to record. Echoing that 0 outward, or
 * copying it into purchase_entitlements.usd_rate (which IS nullable,
 * api/schema.sql:1175), would state a price of zero per SKR to whoever reads the
 * ledger next. `rate_source = 'flat-skr'` is the discriminator, and the
 * normalisation lives HERE ONCE for the MONEY PATH — two readers applying this
 * rule separately is how the response and the ledger come to disagree about one
 * purchase.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ADMIN VIEWS ARE NOT COVERED AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED:
 * api/admin/db.js:312 / :324 and api/admin/stats.js:1061 SELECT usd_rate raw, so
 * those pages show 0.000000000000 for a flat quote. They are operator reads, not
 * money decisions, and they print rate_source in the same row — but do not read
 * this helper's existence as a claim that every reader is normalised.
