// the RATE the verifier accepts.
//
// ⛔ TWO KINDS OF PRICE LIVE IN THIS FILE AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING.
//
//   1. PINNED (the two canaries). Their `amountBaseUnits` is a PROTOCOL CONSTANT
//      — a proof-of-rail, not a sale. The verifier checks it by exact equality
//      and the client mirrors it verbatim (PackCatalog.IsServerPinnedSku).
//      PRICE-PARITY LAW: a build/deploy is forbidden unless the automated parity
//      gate proves every pinned row here equals both canonical client mirrors
//      after exact decimal conversion to base units.
//
//   2. QUOTED (every real pack). Priced in USD, PAID in SKR, so the SKR amount
//      depends on the rate at the moment of purchase. There is no constant to
//      pin. The SERVER resolves the rate, computes the integer base units, and
//      hands the client a short-lived, single-use quote. The client transfers
//      exactly that and does NO arithmetic of its own.
//
// ⛔ WHY A CLIENT-RESOLVED PRICE COULD NEVER WORK: /verify runs AFTER the
// transfer settles. If the client resolves N and the server expects M, the
// purchase fails with THE MONEY ALREADY GONE and nothing granted. And the
// trigger is a MARKET MOVE, not a deploy — nobody is watching when it fires.
// Same paid-but-not-granted family as the 6-vs-9 decimals near-miss, arriving
// through a different door.

/**
 * Who may transact on a network.
 *
 * ⛔ DEVNET IS OPEN, MAINNET IS NOT. Everything below is the mainnet half.
 *
 * ⭐ WIDENED 2026-08-23 (owner ruling, WO-1159 phase 2). Until now mainnet allowed
 * EXACTLY ONE SKU — the 1-SKR canary — for one wallet. That was correct while the
 * canary was the only thing being proven, but it silently blocked the whole ladder:
 * the client shipped go-live (RealmStorePurchase ON, the mainnet payment refusal
 * replaced) while THIS function still answered canary-only, so every store card read
 * "Price unavailable" and the two halves of go-live disagreed with the server winning.
 *
 * The owner's risk argument, and it holds: the published dApp Store build is still on
 * the OLD client (Devnet, purchase flag off), so the only mainnet client in existence
 * is her own sideloaded APK — and every payout resolves to her own treasury.
 *
 * ⛔ SO THE WIDENING IS DELIBERATELY NARROW, IN TWO LAYERS:
 *   1. The OWNER WALLET may buy any sold SKU on mainnet. That is what unblocks her
 *      test, and it can reach nobody else.
 *   2. EVERY OTHER WALLET still needs MAINNET_SALES_ENABLED=true — an ENV switch, so
 *      public mainnet sales can be opened (or shut) without a code change or a deploy
 *      of this file. It defaults CLOSED: absent env == refused.
 *
 * ⚠ The canary keeps its ORIGINAL, STRICTER gate untouched — owner wallet AND
 * MAINNET_CANARY_ENABLED. It is a proof-of-rail, not a sale, and widening sales must
 * never widen it.
 *
 * ⭐ THE TREASURY PRECONDITION IS MET. The revenue vault's Squads threshold is 2-of-3, timeLock 0, RE-VERIFIED ON CHAIN 2026-08-24 (`node tools/treasury-verify.mjs 9wbHbKuirtKai5e3ajvdpzdRYVpuxpAH4DUnERkVtBzj --multisig BcHLoNCsnGD6oegywkP19PALKMQYoFeQWTvmPLmp22no` -> "multisig is 2-of-3, timeLock 0 - production-shaped").
 * No multisig blocker remains on MAINNET_SALES_ENABLED.
 *
 * ⚠ This comment asserted a 1-of-1 blocker until 2026-08-24 and it was STALE. Do not
 * re-cache a threshold here from any doc - the verifier reads it from chain.

 * rounding. This is no longer carried-forward-unendorsed behaviour; it is the
 * authored pricing policy, and this comment is the record of that.
 *
 * The decision was made against measured numbers, not in the abstract. Live at
 * ruling time: low_24h $0.00755954 vs current_price $0.00803436, so a $2.99 pack
 * priced at 396 SKR under this policy against 373 SKR at spot — about 6% more,
 * before ceil() adds its share. WO-1162 §2 proposed replacing this with a short-
 * lived current/executable quote; that proposal is DECLINED and the ticket's §2
 * is closed. Re-opening it needs a NEW owner ruling, not a refactor.
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT THIS RULING DOES NOT LICENSE: silently drifting the policy in either
 * direction. It is now pinned by the pricing regressions (freshness, expiry,
 * rounding, source identity, fail-closed). If a future seat believes spot pricing
 * is better, that is an argument to put to the owner — not a change to make.
