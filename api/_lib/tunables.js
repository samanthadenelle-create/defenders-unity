// =============================================================================
// api/_lib/tunables.js - PROD-022, the REMOTE KNOBS the Pi crash loop is bisected
// with. Read side, validation, and the one writer.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Owner ruling 2026-09-02, verbatim:
//   "make the testing as robust as possible with as many solutions as
//    possible... all we really have to do is just flip a flag and possibly
//    redeploy"
//
// A WebGL rebuild costs about thirty minutes. PROD-022 is a P0 crash loop that
// reproduces inside Pi Browser on the owner's iPhone and NOWHERE else - desktop
// Chrome ran the identical build for 62 minutes. So every candidate mitigation
// ships in ONE build behind its OWN key, all defaulting to today's behaviour,
// and the bisect is flag flips against this table.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ⛔ THIS FILE HOLDS NO DEFAULTS, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The defaults live in the BUILD, in DeNelle.Core.Ops.RemoteTunables.Registry,
// and they are the values the shipping code hardcoded before PROD-022 touched
// it. This table carries OVERRIDES ONLY. An empty table therefore means "today's
// behaviour", and there is exactly one place a default can be read - which is the
// duplicated-state failure CLAUDE.md sections 2, 5 and 16 keep warning about.
//
// The KEY LIST below is duplicated (client registry / this file / the operator
// CLI), and it is duplicated ON PURPOSE and only as an ALLOWLIST: a typo'd key
// must be REFUSED at write time rather than accepted and silently ignored by
// every client forever. It is a spell-check, never a source of truth.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FAIL-TO-DEFAULT. Not fail-open, not fail-closed - nothing here is a seal.
// An unreachable table, a query timeout, a malformed row: readTunables answers
// ok=false, the endpoint reports readOk:false, and every client resolves every
// knob to its shipping default. There is no state in which a failure here can
// make the game behave differently from the build that shipped.
//
// CACHE POLICY mirrors api/_lib/maintenance.js: a short in-lambda memo so one
// warm instance does not re-query Neon per request in a burst. The knobs are
// flipped by a human during a bisect, so a few seconds of lag is invisible.
//
// CommonJS, no dependencies. Files under api/_lib/ are NOT routed by Vercel
// (leading underscore), so this is a library, never an endpoint.
// =============================================================================

/**
 * ALLOWLIST, kept in step BY HAND with DeNelle.Core.Ops.RemoteTunables.Registry
 * and with tools/client-tunables.mjs. It exists so a mistyped key is refused at
 * the moment it is written instead of being accepted and quietly ignored by every
 * client for the rest of the incident.
 *
 * `kind` is checked at write time for the same reason: '2' in a bool is a typo,
 * and the client would fall back to the default and log a bad-value line rather
 * than doing what the operator meant.
