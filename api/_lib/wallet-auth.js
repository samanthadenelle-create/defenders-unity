// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THREE RAILS (two until 2026-08-30), chosen by the SHAPE OF THE PLAYER ID being
// touched — never by what headers the caller happens to send:
//
//   WALLET RAIL  playerId matches ^[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{32,44}$ (base58 Solana
//                address). Requires X-Wallet + X-Nonce + X-Signature: an ed25519
//                signature over the exact canonical message, plus a single-use,
//                5-minute, wallet-bound nonce that is atomically burned. This is
//                the REAL-VALUE rail and its verification is UNCHANGED and
//                UNWEAKENED by the guest work below.
//
//   GUEST RAIL   playerId matches ^guest-local-[0-9a-f]{64}$ — the id the Unity
//                client already mints (GameStateService.EnsureAccount:
//                "guest-local-" + sha256(deviceId + salt)). Requires X-Guest-Id
//                to equal that playerId, and nothing else. See the honesty note
//                on verifyGuest: this is BEARER-TOKEN trust, deliberately and
//                explicitly second-class.
//
//   PLAY RAIL    playerId matches ^play-[0-9a-f]{64}$ — added 2026-08-30 (WO-1282
//                PIN-1b) so a GOOGLE PLAY player, who has no wallet, can key a save
//                and an entitlement. The id is HMAC-SHA256(GOOGLE_IDENTITY_KEY,
//                google_sub) computed SERVER-SIDE from a Google-signed ID token; the
//                client cannot mint one. Requires X-Session, issued only by
//                api/auth/google-session.js. DORMANT unless GOOGLE_IDENTITY_ENABLED.
//                ⛔ THE WALLET REMAINS THE SOLE IDENTITY ON THE SEEKER/APK ARTIFACT
//                   (owner ruling 2026-08-30). This rail is for the Play/AAB artifact
//                   only, and nothing above it is weakened by its existence.
//
// The three id shapes are lexically DISJOINT (a guest id is 76 chars and a play- id
// 69, both containing '-' and hex '0', all of which fail base58; the two prefixes
// differ), so no value can ever be routed to the wrong rail, and no guest header can
// influence a wallet-keyed or play-keyed row.
//
// ── A THIRD RULE, ADDED 2026-08-18 (and the one the shape-disjointness above does
//    NOT give you for free) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Disjoint shapes stop a guest from touching a WALLET-KEYED row. They do NOT stop a
// guest from being handed value keyed to its OWN id — and since the client MINTS
// that id, an attacker mints as many "players" as they like. So:
//
//   ⛔ ROUTES THAT GRANT VALUE CALL authenticateGranting(), NOT authenticate().
//      authenticate()          = "prove you are you" — a guest can.  (save/load/…)
//      authenticateGranting()  = "prove you may be PAID" — a guest never can.
//
// See the corrected honesty note on verifyGuest for the exploit this closed.
//
// ⚠ ONE SCOPED EXCEPTION, ADDED 2026-09-06 (WO-1440, owner ruling): /api/promo/redeem
//   — and ONLY that route — calls authenticatePromoRedeem(), which admits a guest and
//   marks the result `unproven:true` so the caller must clear a non-client-choosable
//   IP budget before paying. The rule above is otherwise untouched: referral claim,
//   entitlements and every other granting route still call authenticateGranting() and
//   still refuse guests. The exception is a NAMED FUNCTION with exactly one caller so
//   that it cannot spread by being the default.
//
// EVERY failure returns a STABLE MACHINE CODE (AuthCode). Before this, all nine
// distinct ways to fail collapsed into one opaque 401 with a prose "reason" sent
// to the PLAYER and nothing kept server-side — you could not tell no-header from
// bad-signature from replayed-nonce from expired-nonce. Now the code goes in the
// (minimal) response and the full context goes in the db (_lib/audit.js).
//
// MESSAGE FORMAT (canonical — the client MUST sign the identical bytes):
//   `dotr-save:v1:<wallet>:<nonce>:<sha256-hex-of-payload-bytes>`
//   UTF-8. Binding the payload hash stops a captured signature being replayed
//   against a DIFFERENT body; binding the nonce stops it being replayed at all.
//   A GET (load) has no body, so the payload segment is the literal "load".
//
// DEPENDENCIES: tweetnacl + bs58 (both in package.json).

// purchase prompts the wallet ONCE (the transfer) instead of three times (connect, a
// per-request auth signature, the transfer).
//
// ⛔ WHY THIS IS SHORT AND WHY IT MUST STAY SHORT. A per-request signature is bound to
// that exact request body and therefore cannot be replayed against a different one. A
// bearer token CAN, until it expires. That is a genuine security reduction, taken
// deliberately to remove a prompt the player should never have seen -- and it is only
// acceptable while the window is small. Do NOT raise this for convenience, and do NOT
// turn it into a permanent login: the whole justification is the size of the window.
const SESSION_TTL_SECONDS = 900; // 15 minutes

// but sliding a window forever IS the "permanent login" the block above forbids. So the
// chain is capped in ABSOLUTE time from the signature that started it: past this, the
// player signs again, no exceptions and no renewal path around it.
//
// ⛔ THE TWO NUMBERS DO DIFFERENT JOBS AND MUST NOT BE CONFLATED. SESSION_TTL_SECONDS is
// how long a STOLEN BEARER TOKEN is useful -- the security window, and it stays at 15
// minutes because renewal ROTATES the token (the old one is revoked on every renew), so
// a captured token still dies in at most a quarter hour. This constant is how long the
// player goes without seeing a wallet sheet -- the UX window. Raising the first weakens

// "play-" + HMAC-SHA256(GOOGLE_IDENTITY_KEY, google_sub) as 64 lowercase hex.
//
// ⛔ THE CLIENT CANNOT MINT ONE. Unlike a guest id (which the device computes and is
//    therefore worth a bearer token and nothing more), this id is derived SERVER-SIDE
//    in _lib/google-identity.derivePlayerId from the `sub` of a Google ID token whose
//    RS256 signature was verified against Google's JWKS. Without GOOGLE_IDENTITY_KEY
//    the value cannot be computed, so an attacker cannot mint players — which is the
//    single property that lets this rail stand next to the wallet on a GRANTING route.
//
// ⛔ AND IT IS LEXICALLY DISJOINT FROM BOTH EXISTING SHAPES, by construction:
//    * fails WALLET_RE — 69 chars (>44), and contains '-' and '0', none of them base58.
//    * fails GUEST_RE  — different literal prefix.
//    Re-checked against both regexes at source on 2026-08-30, and api/auth/google-session.js
//    additionally refuses to issue a session for any derived id that fails PLAY_RE.
//    Disjointness is what stops a Play id being routed to the guest rail's bearer-token
//    trust, or a wallet-keyed row being reachable from this one.

 * GUEST-rail gate.

 * This is BEARER-TOKEN trust, not proof of identity. The only secret is the guest
 * id itself: sha256(deviceUniqueIdentifier + salt), a 256-bit value the device
 * keeps and nobody else can guess. Whoever presents it gets that row — exactly
 * like an unguessable URL. It cannot be revoked, it cannot be transferred to a
 * new device, and it is worth precisely one throwaway tester save.
 *
 * What that buys, and what it must NEVER buy, is enforced structurally, not by
 * convention: a guest id can never satisfy the wallet regex, so it can never key
 * a wallet row, and the wallet rail never consults a guest header.
 *
 * ⚠ CORRECTED 2026-08-18 — the sentence that used to end this paragraph was FALSE
 * and is why an exploit survived a security audit. It read:
 *     "Real-value paths (leaderboard, entitlements, anything on-chain) key off the
 *      wallet and are untouched by this function."
 * They were NOT all untouched. /api/promo/redeem and /api/referral/claim both call
 * authenticate(), which routes a guest-shaped id straight to THIS function — so a
 * self-asserted, unsigned, unlimited-to-mint bearer id was reaching two endpoints
 * that hand out crystals. Because the id is minted by the CLIENT
 * (GameStateService.EnsureAccount: sha256(deviceId + salt)), an attacker chooses it:
 * every fresh 64-hex string is a brand-new "player", which burns a code's
 * max_redemptions (redeem.js counts ROWS) and walks straight past per_player_limit
 * (which counts rows keyed by that same chosen id). Sybil-by-construction.
 * The honest statement of the rule, now ENFORCED instead of asserted:
 *   ⛔ A GUEST MAY NEVER AUTHENTICATE A REQUEST THAT GRANTS VALUE.
 * Value-granting routes call authenticateGranting() (below), not authenticate().
 * Do not "simplify" them back — the distinction IS the fix.
 *
 * ⚠ AMENDED 2026-09-06 (WO-1440), and the amendment is narrow: the owner ruled that
 * /api/promo/redeem — that route alone — may admit a guest, via the separate
 * authenticatePromoRedeem() below. The Sybil property described above is NOT denied
 * by that ruling; it is accepted as a bounded cost, and answered with a global cap
 * plus an IP budget rather than with the guest id. /api/referral/claim, named in the
 * paragraph above, is UNCHANGED and still refuses guests.

 *   order's own instruction: this function may now also stamp `first_seen_staked_at`, once,
 *   on the first observation of a staked wallet. `sgt_mint` and `sgt_verified_at` remain
 *   untouched and the original rule still holds for them.
 *
 * ⛔ THE STAMP IS WRITTEN WITH POSTGRES' CLOCK AND IS IDEMPOTENT BY ITS WHERE CLAUSE.
 *    `SET first_seen_staked_at = NOW() … WHERE first_seen_staked_at IS NULL` — so two

// ── WO-1854 (clan WO-11): THE SEEKER GENESIS TOKEN BINDING ───────────────────
/**
 * BIND THIS WALLET TO THE SEEKER GENESIS TOKEN IT HOLDS, or say why it cannot be.
 *
 * ⛔ IT PROVES NOTHING ABOUT IDENTITY AND MUST NOT PRETEND TO — the work order's own
 * first clause ("assumes the caller already proved wallet control via SIWS or session").
 * It answers "what does address X hold" for an X somebody else already proved. Called
 * from api/clan/vault/register.js AFTER beginClanRequest has verified the caller, and
 * called for wallets that are NOT the caller (a vault's other signers), which is exactly
 * why it cannot be allowed to look like an authentication step.
 *
 * ⛔ IT WRITES wallet_identity FOR A WALLET THAT MAY NEVER HAVE AUTHENTICATED, AND THAT
 *    IS A FIRST FOR THIS FILE. Every other writer here is touchWalletIdentity on the
 *    proven wallet rail. A vault signer, though, is an address the LEADER named: a real
 *    Seeker owner who may have no row at all. The work order says "set sgt_mint /
 *    sgt_verified_at on the current wallet's row" — but an UPDATE would move ZERO ROWS
 *    for such a signer and the binding would silently not persist, which would leave the
 *    reuse check with nothing to compare against and let a SECOND clan bind the same
 *    device. So this is an INSERT … ON CONFLICT (wallet) DO UPDATE.
 *    ⚠ api/_lib/clan-http.js's header states "ONLY the wallet rail ever writes that
 *      table"; that sentence is now narrower than the truth. It is NOT edited here (that
 *      file belongs to another lane this session) — it is flagged in this ticket's
 *      implementation record for the lead, per CLAUDE.md §15.
 *
 * ⛔ AND `sgt_reused` IS DECIDED BY THE DATABASE, NOT BY A PRE-SELECT. Migration 0036
 *    adds `wallet_identity_sgt_mint_unique` (partial, WHERE sgt_mint IS NOT NULL), so the
 *    write is attempted and a 23505 IS the refusal. A read-then-write would let two
 *    wallets verifying the same mint at the same moment both see "nobody has it" and both
 *    succeed — the exact Sybil shape verifyGuest's honesty note describes, applied to a
 *    device instead of a player id. The SELECT below runs only to LABEL the refusal, and
 *    as the fallback for a deployment where 0036 has not been applied yet. Same division
 *    of labour as consumeNonce: the write is the authority, the read is the diagnosis.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS. Every outcome is `{ok:false, reason}` or `{ok:true, mint}`.
 *
 * @param {Function} sql     neon(...) tagged-template client

 * that risk stated to her explicitly: an acquisition promo that refuses everyone it
 * exists to acquire is worth nothing, the live FIRSTWATCH campaign points at the
 * PUBLISHED dApp-Store build (which cannot be changed inside the campaign's life),
 * and the exposure is bounded by the code's own global cap rather than being an
 * unbounded drain. See api/promo/redeem.js's header for the full record, including
 * the residual risk.
 *
 * ⛔ IT IS A SEPARATE FUNCTION, NOT A FLAG ON authenticateGranting(), for exactly the
 *    reason authenticateGranting() is itself separate from authenticate(): a boolean
 *    parameter makes the safe answer the one you have to remember to ask for. Every
 *    other value-granting route keeps calling authenticateGranting() and keeps
 *    refusing guests. `grep authenticatePromoRedeem` returns one caller, forever.
