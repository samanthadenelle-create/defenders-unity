// =============================================================================
// api/_lib/pi-payments.js — WO-1318. The Pi (U2A) money rail.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ⛔ THIS IS A SECOND RAIL, NOT A SECOND STORE. It reuses, verbatim and by
// require(), everything the SKR rail already decided:
//
//   * the USD ANCHOR LADDER          -> purchase-catalog.usdAnchor(sku)
//   * the 24h-LOW rate policy         -> the same CoinGecko markets endpoint and
//                                        the same `low_24h` field, for pi-network
//   * FAIL-CLOSED pricing             -> rate unavailable => NO quote, ever a 503,
//                                        never a stale or invented number
//   * the QUOTE TABLE                 -> purchase_quotes (one row, single-use, TTL'd)
//   * the GRANT LEDGER                -> purchase_entitlements (rail = 'pi')
//
// The only genuinely new artefact is `pi_payments`, the rail's LIFECYCLE ledger —
// exactly the shape `google_play_purchases` already has for the Play rail. It is
// not an entitlement and it grants nothing; it records approve -> complete so a
// replayed callback can be recognised as a replay.
//
// ⛔ THE SECURITY INVARIANT, AND WHERE IT IS ENFORCED.
// The client NEVER sets the amount. `Pi.createPayment({ amount })` runs on the
// player's device, so the number in the Pi payment object is CLIENT-SUPPLIED and
// must be treated as hostile. The server:
//   1. computes the amount from the USD anchor and the live rate,
//   2. persists it against a quote id (purchase_quotes.amount_base_units),
//   3. re-reads the payment FROM PI at approve, and refuses to approve unless the
//      payment's amount equals the persisted one EXACTLY (integer compare in base
//      units — never a float ==),
//   4. re-checks the same thing at complete, because the money has moved by then
//      and a wrong grant cannot be taken back.
// A forged amount therefore never reaches `POST /v2/payments/:id/approve`, which
// is the only signature that can move a Pioneer's Pi.
//
// ⛔ THE API KEY. `PI_NETWORK_API_KEY` is server-only. It is read here, sent only
// in an `Authorization: Key ...` header to api.minepi.com, and is never returned,
// logged, echoed in an error, or written to a file. Every helper below that
// touches it returns a CODE, never the upstream body.
// =============================================================================

// discountLabelFor is shared with the SKR rail on purpose (WO-1799): one wording
// decision per discount reason, so a sale cannot read "30% off" on one rail and
// "30% shortfall discount" on the other.
const { usdAnchor, discountLabelFor, QUOTE_TTL_SECONDS } = require('./purchase-catalog');

// ── What is sellable on the Pi rail ─────────────────────────────────────────
// ⭐ ONE SKU, DELIBERATELY (owner ruling, WO-1318). No purchase has ever
// completed in this game, so the rail is proven on a single pack rather than 28
// that could all fail identically. Widening this list is a product decision, not
// a refactor: every SKU here must also carry a USD anchor in purchase-catalog.

// The SKR rail rounds UP to a WHOLE SKR because an SPL transfer moves an integer
// number of base units and the client mirrors that integer verbatim. Pi's SDK
// takes a DECIMAL amount, so there is no such constraint, and ceil()-ing to a
// whole Pi at ~$0.09/Pi would add up to ~1.8% to a $4.99 pack for no technical
// reason at all.
//
// So the Pi rail keeps the DIRECTION of the SKR policy — always at least spot,
// never less — at a precision that costs the player nothing: CEIL TO 0.01 Pi
// (worst case ~$0.001 over). The 24h-LOW rate source is unchanged and is the
// owner's ruling verbatim ("just like with SKR we're gonna do the floor of 24
// hour window").
