            // library for Unity (Cysharp). It is not crypto code, it has no wallet, chain,
            // token or payment surface, and it has nothing to do with Solana beyond WHERE ITS
            // FILES SIT ON DISK: the Solana SDK vendors it INSIDE its own package folder, so
            // every UniTask source path reads
            // Packages/com.solana.unity_sdk/Runtime/Plugins/UniTask/Runtime/<File>.cs.
            // Sixteen first-party asmdefs - DeNelle.Core and DeNelle.Village among them -
            // reference the UniTask assembly, so it compiles into the GOOGLE_PLAY player by
            // design, and IL2CPP writes each source file PATH into global-metadata.dat.
            //
            // WHY A VENDORED PATH STRING IS NOT A POLICY SURFACE. The token here is a
            // DIRECTORY NAME carried by a debug-metadata path, not a feature, not a string a
            // player or a reviewer can reach through the app, and not code that can talk to a
            // chain. Nothing in the artifact behaves differently for its presence. No build
            // callback can strip it either: the path is baked by IL2CPP from the file's
            // location on disk, so the only true removal is un-vendoring UniTask
            // (com.cysharp.unitask + dropping the SDK from the Play manifest), which needs a
            // manifest swap, a package resolve and a full recompile - see WO-1740 s5 Q1(i).
            // This entry is the owner's ruling of 2026-09-15 on that ceiling: allowlist the
            // UniTask paths, with the reason written down, rather than leave the Play lane
            // permanently red on a folder name.
            //

            // codebase/ (IWalletBase, InGameWallet, DeepLinkWallets, Metaplex) and Plugins/,
            // and UniTask's OWN SIBLINGS inside Plugins/ are SolanaWalletAdapterWebGL/ and
            // Web3AuthSDK/. Those are real crypto surfaces. An allowlist on the package - or
            // even on Runtime/Plugins/ - would suppress them too. Scoped as written, a leak
            // from any of them still fires, because IsAllowlistedOccurrence suppresses a hit
