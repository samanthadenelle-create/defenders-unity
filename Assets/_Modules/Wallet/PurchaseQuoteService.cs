// PurchaseQuoteService — the client ASKS for the price. It never decides one.

// Assembly: DeNelle.Wallet   Namespace: DeNelle.Wallet   (WO-1158)
//
// ⛔ THE ONE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: THERE IS NO PRICE ARITHMETIC ON
// THE CLIENT. A pack is priced in USD and paid in SKR, so the SKR amount depends
// on the market rate at purchase time. Before this file the CLIENT resolved that
// rate (SkrValuationOracle.SkrForUsd) while the SERVER verified the transfer
// against a hardcoded constant.
//
// A CLIENT-RESOLVED PRICE AND A SERVER-CHECKED CONSTANT CANNOT BOTH BE RIGHT.
// The moment the market moves the client sends N and the server expects M —
// and /verify runs AFTER the transfer settles, so the purchase fails with THE
// MONEY ALREADY GONE and nothing granted. The trigger is a MARKET MOVE, which is
// not a deploy, so nobody is watching when it fires. Same paid-but-not-granted
// family as the 6-vs-9 decimals near-miss, through a different door.
//
// So: the server resolves the rate, computes the integer base units, and hands
// back a short-lived, single-use quote. This file transports it and hands it to
// the store verbatim. It computes nothing. Where you see arithmetic below it is
// a GUARD — proving the number we are about to pay is bit-for-bit the number we
// were quoted — never a derivation.
//
// TWO CALLS, ONE ENDPOINT (api/purchases/quote.js):
//   RefreshPricesAsync  — the shelf's display prices. Binds nothing.
//   RequestQuoteAsync   — ONE binding quote for ONE purchase. Expires. Single-use.
//
// ⛔ FAILS CLOSED, EVERYWHERE. No rate → no price → no Buy button and a worded
// reason. A displayed price we invented is worse than no price at all, because
// the player acts on it.
